## 2005 - 2011: The Beginning and Teater Liksom

The predecessor to Impro Neuf is believed to have been established around 2005 under the name "Mandagsimpro" (Monday Improv), as a subgroup of Teater Neuf. The group's activities involved organizing weekly meetups to practice improvised theater. 

In 2006/2007, Impro Neuf was led by Mats Eldøen and Simen Hovd, who later became key figures at Det Andre Teatret (The Other Theater). Along with another future central figure, Nils Petter Mørland, they founded a new subgroup of Teater Neuf in 2007 called "Teater Liksom." Teater Liksom organized Micetro for many years and experimented with formats like "Life Game" before moving in 2011, popcorn machine in tow, to their new home, Det Andre Teatret.

## 2011 - 2013: Mandagsimpro and Onsdagsimpro

Although Teater Liksom attracted the majority of the improv community to Det Andre Teatret, Mandagsimpro continued its weekly sessions at Chateau Neuf. Leadership, names, and meeting days changed frequently during this period:

- **2011-2012:** Felicia Batt-Rawden (Mandagsimpro)
- **2012-2013:** Ingrid Wester Amundsen (Onsdagsimpro)

## 2013 - 2015: Impro Neuf Takes Shape

The group typically had around 10-15 active members and a high turnover rate until January 2014, when they started organizing monthly shows featuring a modified version of Gorilla Theater alongside their weekly workshops. From then on, the group grew rapidly, with more frequent shows and an increasing number of active members. The name Impro Neuf emerged during the 2013/2014 transition period, coinciding with the group's first show in Lillesalen. During this time, the group was led by:

- **2013-2014:** Vebjørn Tveiterås (Torsdagsimpro / Impro Neuf)
- **2014-2015:** Tord Bjørnevaagen Brandsæter

## 2015 - Present: Impro Neuf

On May 10, 2015, a general meeting decided that Impro Neuf would establish its own board. The decision was made through a vote. A new board is elected at the annual general meeting. With the board came a permanent ensemble and more frequent performances. In October 2016, the group separated from Teater Neuf and became an independent organization. The board has had the following compositions:

- **2015-2016:** Terje Brevik (leader), Sverre Breian, and Tord Bjørnevaagen Brandsæter
- **2016-2017:** Terje Brevik (leader), Sverre Breian, and Marie Folkeson

## 2015 - Present: Impro Neuf International

In 2015, Aree Witoelar initiated the creation of a subgroup, Impro Neuf International, which conducts weekly English-language improv sessions. The workshops are attended by both internationals and Norwegians. At the same time, he also started the English-speaking improv group Speakeasy, focusing on long-form improv. In 2016, Impro Neuf International has performed at Henriken under the name The Improv Speakeasy. Eventually in 2017 the shows moved back to our current home Chateau Neuf, with open spaces for multiple teams.

## 2017 - Present: Impro Neuf Presents...

At the board's request, Harald Wille Jordheim established a subgroup of Impro Neuf in 2017, focusing on musical improv. This group performs monthly shows at Teaterkjellern and includes members from the ensemble as well as external groups.
